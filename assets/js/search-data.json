The average RATING for free apps performed hilarousily better than that of paid apps (3.83 &gt; 2.47). This is even more surprising when considering the fact that the statistics for the NO_OF_PEOPLE for both the free apps and the paid apps are almost similar i.e an equal number of people have rated them. This by itself is an interesting question ? What&#39;s the reason for this particular column to be almost identical for both the stratas ? . free_app_df[&quot;Rating&quot;].mode() . 0 4.0 dtype: float64 . Have you ever wanted to rate an app but don&#39;t feel like giving it a solid 5 ? But you don&#39;t want to look bad so you don&#39;t want to give it a 3 or lower. So what do you do ? Give it a 4 of course! . I wonder if my amatuer psychological deduction is the reason for such observation ? . free_app_df.Category.describe() . count 5163 unique 13 top Music freq 753 Name: Category, dtype: object . free_app_df[&quot;Category&quot;].unique() . array([&#39;Books&#39;, &#39;Business&#39;, &#39;Developer Tools&#39;, &#39;Social&#39;, &#39;Food and Dining&#39;, &#39;Government and Politics&#39;, &#39;Health and Fitness&#39;, &#39;Kids and Family&#39;, &#39;Lifestyle&#39;, &#39;Multimedia Design&#39;, &#39;Music&#39;, &#39;Navigation and Maps&#39;, &#39;News and Weather&#39;, nan], dtype=object) . For free apps, we can see a phelotra of categories prevailing in the app market, with Music apps being the most popular. . You know what! I would like to explore how differently each category of apps have been rated i.e lets found out the mean rating for each category of apps. . free_app_df[[&quot;Category&quot;, &quot;Rating&quot;]].groupby(&quot;Category&quot;).mean() . Rating . Category . Books 3.884793 | . Business 3.780702 | . Developer Tools 3.952222 | . Food and Dining 3.789157 | . Government and Politics 4.050000 | . Health and Fitness 3.785579 | . Kids and Family 3.947826 | . Lifestyle 3.850610 | . Multimedia Design 3.551282 | . Music 3.759628 | . Navigation and Maps 3.801948 | . News and Weather 3.837474 | . Social 3.847561 | . Now that&#39;s surely a surprise ! The category with the highest rating is &quot;Government and Politics&quot;, followed by not so surprisingly &quot;Developer Tools&quot; and &quot;Kids and Family&quot;. Needless to say, none of the individual category&#39;s rating deviate significantly from the average rating of the free apps (3.83). . Now I shall be doing the same visualization tasks as I had done for the paid apps. . df_plot_count = free_app_df[[&quot;Rating&quot;, &quot;Date&quot;]].groupby(pd.Grouper(key=&quot;Date&quot;, freq=&quot;Y&quot;)).count() plt.figure(figsize=(16,7)) plt.title(&quot;Free apps launched per year&quot;) plot = sns.lineplot(data = df_plot_count) plot.xaxis.set_major_formatter(dates.DateFormatter(&quot;%Y&quot;)) plot.set(ylabel = &quot;COUNT&quot;) plot.legend(labels=[&quot;COUNT&quot;]) plt.show() . Interesting indeed! The graph shows that the no of free apps launched peaked in 2017, after which it started to decline. Right now I can&#39;t think of anything which could be a precursor to it. If you can think of something then please let me know in the comments. . Moving on... . Now I will be exploring seasonality trends for No of people who rated the apps and rating. . df_plot_data = free_app_df[[&quot;Date&quot;, &quot;No of people Rated&quot;, &quot;Rating&quot;]] df_plot_data.set_index(&quot;Date&quot;, inplace=True) df_plot_data = df_plot_data.groupby(pd.Grouper(freq=&#39;M&#39;)).mean().dropna(how=&quot;all&quot;) df_plot_data.sort_index(axis = 0) plt.figure(figsize=(16,7)) plt.title(&quot;No of People Seasonality analysis&quot;) plot = sns.lineplot(data=df_plot_data[&quot;No of people Rated&quot;]) plot.xaxis.set_minor_locator(dates.MonthLocator()) #plot.xaxis.set_major_formatter(dates.DateFormatter(&quot;%Y&quot;)) plt.show() . This graph clearly shows that the no of people who have rated the free app started declining from 2012 onwards, with significant drops in the year of 2020. Generally, the range of people rating the app is averaging around 100. This could also indicate that any promotional campaign conducted by Microsoft to increase its app store visibility and to encourage people to rate the apps have not been quite successful. . plt.figure(figsize=(16,7)) plt.title(&quot;Rating Seasonality analysis&quot;) plot = sns.lineplot(data=df_plot_data[&quot;Rating&quot;]) plot.xaxis.set_minor_locator(dates.MonthLocator()) #plot.xaxis.set_major_formatter(dates.DateFormatter(&quot;%Y&quot;)) plt.show() . On the other hand, the average Rating for free apps have started improving from 2018 onwards. This can be attributed to a key system update of the app store in 2018 which allowed Progressive Web Appilications (Basically app built through web technologies like HTML, CSS and Javascript). Its been documented that implementation of this technology resulted in improvement in KPIs such as average time spend on a page, conversion rate etc. . So with this I conclude my analysis of the Windows App Store dataset. I hope you guys like my work and please let me know your suggestions and feedback. See you then! .",

If you haven&#39;t checked out part 2 already then please use this link to access the article: . https://www.kaggle.com/sanchitagarwal/windows-store-eda-1 . A quick look at the data revealed that the majority of the data (97%) are free apps (price = 0), so I decided to stratify the dataset into categories &quot;Free&quot; and &quot;Paid&quot; based on the value of the PRICE column; The intutition being that the behviour of the population intenting to purchase an application and the resultant characterstics will be significantly different than those who aren&#39;t. Nevertheless, later on, I shall seek correlation between both the stratas. . Lets start with the &quot;Paid&quot; category first. .

In the RATING column we can see that the average rating for paid apps is a mere 2.47, a horrondous result considering that one would expect a better user experience on apps which have been paid for. . In the PRICE column, the range is pretty large (5449 - 54 = 5395), and so is the standard deviation, meaning there is a lot of variance in the prices. Interesting thing to know is that both the 50th &amp; 75th percentile equals 269, meaning that 269 is the most commonly used to price apps. This can be verified by finding the mode of the PRICE column. . paid_apps_df[&quot;Price&quot;].mode() . 0 269.0 dtype: float64 . Voila!! . paid_apps_df.Category.describe() . count 158 unique 3 top Books freq 56 Name: Category, dtype: object . paid_apps_df.Category.unique() . array([&#39;Books&#39;, &#39;Business&#39;, &#39;Developer Tools&#39;], dtype=object) . &quot;Book&quot; being the top category in paid apps confirms books to be the most popular product a person is willing to pay for, though abeit by a very small margin (56/158 = 0.3544 * 100 = 35.44%). Also to note that there are 8 records with NULL entry for the CATEGORY column. . Now lets do some plotting! . df_plot_count = paid_apps_df[[&quot;Rating&quot;, &quot;Date&quot;]].groupby(pd.Grouper(key=&quot;Date&quot;, freq=&#39;Y&#39;)).count() #print(df_plot_count) plt.figure(figsize=(15,6)) plt.title(&quot;Paid Apps launched per year&quot;) plot = sns.lineplot(data=df_plot_count) plot.xaxis.set_major_formatter(dates.DateFormatter(&quot;%Y&quot;)) plot.set(ylabel = &quot;Count&quot;) plot.legend(labels=[&quot;Count&quot;]) plt.show() . This graph shows that the number of paid apps launched is increasing almost exponentially. This tells us the increase in popularity of Windows app ecosystem. . I am interested in knowing if there is any seasonality trend amongest PRICE, RATING and NO_OF_PEOPLE. . df_plot = paid_apps_df[[&quot;Date&quot;, &quot;Rating&quot;, &#39;No of people Rated&#39;, &quot;Price&quot;]] df_plot.set_index(&#39;Date&#39;, inplace=True) df_plot = df_plot.groupby(pd.Grouper(freq=&#39;M&#39;)).mean().dropna(how=&quot;all&quot;) plt.figure(figsize=(15,6)) plt.title(&quot;PRICE Seasonality analysis&quot;) plot = sns.lineplot(data= df_plot[&quot;Price&quot;]) plot.set(ylabel = &quot;Price&quot;) plot.xaxis.set_minor_locator(dates.MonthLocator()) plot.xaxis.set_major_formatter(dates.DateFormatter(&quot;%Y&quot;)) plt.show() . From 2011 to 2013, the increase was almost linear but later on there are sudden surges followed by a decrease, like a sine wave. . Also to note that for years 2013, 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2020, surge in price are detected in the first months (Jan, Feb, March). What could cause this pattern to reemerge ? Something to ponder about. . Lastly, from 2020 onwards, the prices are in the low territory compared to previous year&#39;s. I believe this can be attributed to the change in pricing strategy (where apps are free to download with additional content available to purchase) and/or increase in piracy. . plt.figure(figsize=(15,6)) plt.title(&quot;RATING seasonality analysis&quot;) plot = sns.lineplot(data= df_plot[[&quot;Rating&quot;]]) plot.xaxis.set_minor_locator(dates.MonthLocator()) plot.set(ylabel = &quot;Rating&quot;) plot.xaxis.set_major_formatter(dates.DateFormatter(&quot;%Y&quot;)) plt.show() . We can see that there is an increase in volatility as we move further down the x-axis. This could be attributed to the increase in number of apps published through the years as explored in the first graph. . plt.figure(figsize=(15,6)) plt.title(&quot;No of people seasonality analysis&quot;) plot = sns.lineplot(data= df_plot[[&quot;No of people Rated&quot;]]) plot.xaxis.set_minor_locator(dates.MonthLocator()) plot.xaxis.set_major_formatter(dates.DateFormatter(&quot;%Y&quot;)) plt.show() . This graph and the previous graph are almost similar (which makes perfect sense since the set of people who rated the apps is subset of set of people who have downloaded the app, i.e not all people who downloaded the app may have rated the app but those who have rated the app have definitely downloaded it!). . Nothing new to explore here. . Now lets find any correlation between PRICE and RATING. . plt.figure(figsize=(15,6)) plt.title(&quot;Correlation between Price &amp; Rating&quot;) plot = sns.scatterplot(y=paid_apps_df[&quot;Price&quot;], x=paid_apps_df[&quot;Rating&quot;]) plt.show() . For the 4 rating, the range of price is the largest, while the perfect 5 rating has been achieved by relatively inexpensive apps. This affirms the fact that the mere price tag of an application is not the sole indication of the user experience. This is further stated by the 3 rating achieved by the humongously priced &quot;5449&quot; app. . Thats it for now. In the next article I will continue with my analysis of the &quot;Free apps&quot; strata of the dataset. Please don&#39;t hesitate to share your feedbacks. Thanks! .",

            "content": "Today I will be doing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on The Windows Store dataset by @Vishnu. . I love Docker to keep everything compartmentalize and neat. Plus, it also ensures you that you can also easily shift (and scale) your system to any of your favorite cloud provider like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud etc. If you don&#39;t know what Docker is then I highly suggest you to check out this link . https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-docker-and-why-is-it-so-darn-popular/ . For meeting my relational database needs, I am choosing an official docker image of SQL Server 2019 version. One free tip for you guys: . if you are doing anything with your containers which you would have to access later, don&#39;t forget to use persistant storage. And please use volumes, not bind mounts (Will explain this in some future article). . For setting up my Python IDE, I downloaded an official docker image of Jupyter notebook (not the Jupyter lab), which was super easy to setup. Just don&#39;t forget to enable port forwarding between the container and the host on 8888. I first thought of building my own python notebook docker image from scratch but then I procastinated it till the near future. Here&#39;s the link to that image: . https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/minimal-notebook . For those who have just entered the Docker realm, it&#39;s dangerous to go alone. Take these docker commands! . docker rename &lt;old_container_name&gt; &lt;new_container_name&gt; . Self explantory . | docker cp &lt;host_filepath&gt; &lt;container_filepath&gt; . For copying a file located in your local system to a container. . | docker ps -a . Lists all docker containers . | docker exec -it &lt;container_name&gt; &quot;bash&quot; . Opens a bash terminal connected with the forementioned container . | docker images . Lists all images downloaded on the local system. You can use docker images rm to do housecleaning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; The dataset contains 6 columns, which are pretty self explanatory, so I won&#39;t be explaning them here. They are also mentioned in the dataset&#39;s description. . A quick look at the dataset through Excel revealed that the date column contained values in 2 different formats, which had to be fixed before I can import it into SQL Server. Even after using Excel&#39;s default data formatting,only values belonging to one particular format got converted into DateTime datatype, and the rest still remained as text strings. Fear not! As by using some clever usage of Excel formulas, this was resolved. . Basically, by extracting substrings from the values and feeding them individually as date components in the date formula, as I was able to convert the remaining values. . Here&#39;s the snippet: . IF(ISTEXT($E4), DATE( RIGHT($E4,4), MID($E4,4,2), LEFT($E4,2)), $E4) . The IF condition checks if the value is actually a text or a number (since the column contained both) &amp; RIGHT, MID and LEFT are positional string extraction methods. . Here&#39;s the result: . . I replaced commas in the values of the NAME column so that it would be much easier to import the whole dataset into the SQL Server, as a CSV file. . The PRICE column consisted mostly of &quot;Free&quot; (which I replaced with 0), and the remaining values were concatenated with the ₹ currency symbol. Apparently, Excel doesn&#39;t give us any decent inbuilt method to extract numbers from text, and so, I had to take a more comprehensive approach. Here&#39;s the full formula: . VALUE(RIGHT(F5164, LEN(F5164) - MIN(SEARCH({0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}, $F5164&amp;&quot;123456789&quot;)) + 1)) . Lets break it down, shall we! . MIN(SEARCH({0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}, $F5164&amp;&quot;123456789&quot;) . I use the SEARCH function to find the location of the first digit in the string. Here, the constant array {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} defines all the digits I need to search and $F5164&amp;&quot;123456789&quot; is the target cell, concatenated with string &quot;1234567890&quot; to help provide the SEARCH function with a &quot;fake&quot; position for digits which are not there in the target cell. . Finally, MIN function is used to give the smallest value from the result of the SEARCH function, corrosponding to the location of the first digit in the string. . | RIGHT(F5164, LEN(F5164) - MIN(SEARCH({0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}, $F5164&amp;&quot;123456789&quot;)) + 1) . Here we use RIGHT function, which extracts a given length of substring from a string starting from the right side. The first digit location is subtracted from the total length of the main string to get the total number of digits to be extracted. 1 is added to count for the first digit itself. . | VALUE(RIGHT(............................)) . Since Excel will return the substring as a text, which i certainly don&#39;t want, I used the VALUE function to convert them into numbers. . | After the data cleaning was done, I was ready to upload the data to the SQL server. I used the BULK INSERT function to import my CSV into a already made, nice and juicy SQL table. Here&#39;s the full syntax: . bulk insert into WINDOWS_STORE from &quot;/datasets/msft.csv&quot; with(firstrow = 2, type = &quot;csv&quot;) . FIRSTROW parameter is used to tell the function to ignore the header row when importing. . One thing, which I ignored in my early data cleaning shenanigans and caused me a lot of distress while I tried to figure out why my SQL syntax was not working, was quite a few records contained names with special characters, which the VARCHAR datatype doesn&#39;t support. I had to alter my table&#39;s NAME column to have NVARCHAR as its datatype. This solved the problem. . So this is it for now. To conclude, I was able to setup a local containerized development environment on my laptop, cleaned my data and, imported it to my local SQL server instance. . In my next article, I will start with the fun part: Exploring and Visualizing. . &lt;/div&gt; . | .",
